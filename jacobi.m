function [x, iter, xall] = jacobi(A, b, x0, tol, max_iter)
% JACOBI Solves the system Ax=b using Jacobi iterative method
%
% x = jacobi(A, b, x0, tol, max_iter) computes the solution to the
% system Ax=b using x0 as a starting vector. The convergence criterion is
% set to:
%
%          || x^(k) - x^(k-1) ||_{inf}
%         ------------------------------ < tol.
%                  || x^(k) ||_{inf}
%
% The solver stops iterating once the maximum number of iterations has been
% reached, in case convergence was not detected earlier.
%
% [x, iter] = jacobi(A, b, x, tol, max_iter) works as above but the solver
% now also returns the number of iterations that the solver took
%
% [x, iter, xall] = jacobi(A, b, x, tol, max_iter) works as above but now
% the solver also returns *all* Jacobi iterations.
